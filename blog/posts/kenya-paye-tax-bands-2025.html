            <h2>Compliance and Due Dates</h2>
            
            <h3>For Employers</h3>
            <p>Employers must deduct PAYE from employees' salaries and remit the amounts to KRA on or before the 9th day of the following month. A PAYE return must also be filed through iTax on or before the 9th day of the following month.</p>

            <h3>Penalties for Non-Compliance</h3>
            <p>Late filing attracts the higher of 25% of the tax due or KES 10,000. Late payment incurs a penalty of 5% of the tax due plus 1% interest per month on unpaid tax.</p>

            <h3>Housing Levy Penalties</h3>
            <p>Failure to remit the Affordable Housing Levy by the due date attracts a penalty of 3% per month on the outstanding amount.</p>

        <section id="key-changes">
            <h2>Key Changes in 2025</h2>

            <h3>1. Enhanced NSSF Contributions</h3>
            <p>The NSSF Act 2013 entered its third implementation phase in February 2025, with tier I contributions increasing from KES 420 to KES 480 and tier II contributions increasing from KES 1,740 to KES 3,840. This represents the most significant change to retirement savings in Kenya since the implementation of the NSSF Act.</p>
            
            <p>The government aims to amass KES 1 trillion through these increased contributions by 2027, making NSSF one of the largest pension funds in Africa. This gradual implementation was designed to ease the transition for both employers and employees while ensuring adequate retirement savings for Kenyan workers.</p>

            <h3>2. Allowable Deductions for SHIF and Housing Levy</h3>
            <p>The shift to treat AHL and SHIF as allowable deductions is beneficial to employees, as it lowers the taxable income, reducing the overall tax liability. This change partially offsets the increased financial burden that these levies initially created when they were introduced.</p>

            <h3>3. Removal of Certain Tax Reliefs</h3>
            <p>The 15% reliefs for SHIF contributions and housing levy payments were repealed in December 2024, simplifying the tax calculation process. This streamlining measure reduces administrative complexity while ensuring that the tax system remains progressive and equitable.</p>

            <p>The combination of increased NSSF contributions and the introduction of SHIF and housing levy significantly impacts employees' disposable income. While the treatment of AHL and SHIF as allowable deductions provides some relief, the increased NSSF contributions will further decrease employees' net pay, limiting their disposable income.</p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <h4>Sample Impact Analysis (KES 100,000 Gross Salary)</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>NSSF (Old Rate): KES 2,160</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>NSSF (New Rate): KES 4,320</li>
                    <li>SHIF: KES 2,750</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Kenya's 2025 PAYE system represents a significant evolution in the country's approach to income taxation and social security. The system successfully balances multiple objectives: generating revenue for government operations, funding critical social programs, and maintaining economic competitiveness in the region.</p>

            <p>The current framework reflects years of careful policy development, incorporating lessons learned from previous implementations and responding to changing economic realities. The progressive tax structure ensures that higher earners contribute proportionally more while providing meaningful relief for lower-income workers through personal allowances and allowable deductions.</p>

            <h3>Key Policy Achievements</h3>
