            <h1>Kenya PAYE Tax Bands ‚Äì 2025: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Understanding the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax system is crucial for both employees and employers in Kenya. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) administers PAYE, requiring employers to deduct income tax from their employees' earnings and remit it to the government. This article provides an in-depth look at the PAYE tax bands effective from July 1, 2023, statutory deductions, recent legislative changes, and practical guidance for compliance.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>The PAYE system is a progressive tax mechanism where employees' income is taxed at varying rates based on their earnings.</strong> <br> <strong>The Finance Act 2023 established the current tax bands, which remain effective through 2025.</strong> <br> <strong>Understanding these bands is essential for accurate tax computation and compliance.</strong> ([payecalculatorkenya.pro](https://payecalculatorkenya.pro/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [kra.go.ke](https://www.kra.go.ke/individual/filing-paying/types-of-taxes/paye?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>Understanding PAYE (Pay As You Earn)</h2>

<h3>Definition and Purpose of PAYE</h3>
<p><strong>PAYE is a method of income tax collection where employers deduct tax from employees' salaries and remit it to the KRA.</strong> <br> <strong>This system ensures regular tax collection and reduces the burden on individuals to file taxes independently.</strong> ([kra.go.ke](https://www.kra.go.ke/images/publications/PAYE-AS-YOU-EARN-PAYE_4-01-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h3>Who Is Subject to PAYE?</h3>
<p><strong>All salaried individuals earning above KSh 24,000 per month are subject to PAYE.</strong> <br> <strong>This includes Kenyan residents and non-residents earning income within Kenya.</strong> <br> <strong>Employers are responsible for registering with the KRA and ensuring compliance with PAYE obligations.</strong> ([payecalculatorkenya.pro](https://payecalculatorkenya.pro/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [taxsummaries.pwc.com](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/kenya/individual/taxes-on-personal-income?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>PAYE Tax Bands Effective from 1st July 2023</h2>
<p><strong>The PAYE tax bands are structured as follows:</strong></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Monthly Income (KSh)</th>
      <th>Annual Income (KSh)</th>
      <th>Tax Rate (%)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Up to 24,000</td>
      <td>Up to 288,000</td>
      <td>10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>24,001 ‚Äì 32,333</td>
      <td>288,001 ‚Äì 388,000</td>
      <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>32,334 ‚Äì 500,000</td>
      <td>388,001 ‚Äì 6,000,000</td>
      <td>30%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>500,001 ‚Äì 800,000</td>
      <td>6,000,001 ‚Äì 9,600,000</td>
      <td>32.5%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Above 800,000</td>
      <td>Above 9,600,000</td>
      <td>35%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Additionally, a personal relief of KSh 2,400 per month (KSh 28,800 annually) is granted to all taxpayers.</strong> ([kra.go.ke](https://www.kra.go.ke/individual/filing-paying/types-of-taxes/paye?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>Statutory Deductions Affecting PAYE Calculations</h2>

<h3>National Social Security Fund (NSSF)</h3>
<p><strong>Effective from February 1, 2025, NSSF contributions are structured into two tiers:</strong> ([faidihr.com](https://faidihr.com/blog/employers-guide-to-payroll-tax-in-kenya-2025-edition?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tier I</strong>: 6% of the first KSh 8,000 of monthly earnings (KSh 480 each from employer and employee).</li>
  <li><strong>Tier II</strong>: 6% of earnings between KSh 8,001 and KSh 72,000 (up to KSh 3,840 each from employer and employee).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The maximum total contribution per party is KSh 4,320 monthly.</strong> ([faidihr.com](https://faidihr.com/blog/employers-guide-to-payroll-tax-in-kenya-2025-edition?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h3>Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF)</h3>
<p><strong>With the introduction of the Social Health Authority under the Social Health Insurance Act, 2024, the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) was replaced by SHIF.</strong> <br> <strong>Contributions are mandatory for all employees and are based on income brackets.</strong> <br> <strong>The contribution rate is 2.75% of the employee's gross salary, with a minimum of KSh 300 and no maximum cap.</strong> <br> <strong>Employers are required to deduct the contributions and remit them to the Social Health Authority.</strong> ([faidihr.com](https://faidihr.com/blog/employers-guide-to-payroll-tax-in-kenya-2025-edition?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h3>Affordable Housing Levy</h3>
<p><strong>The Affordable Housing Levy was reintroduced under the Affordable Housing Act of 2024.</strong> <br> <strong>Effective from March 19, 2024, both the employee and employer are each required to pay 1.5% of the monthly gross salary as a housing levy.</strong> <br> <strong>This contribution is fully tax-deductible.</strong> ([aren.co.ke](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>Non-Cash Benefits and Their Tax Implications</h2>
<p><strong>Employers often provide non-cash benefits to employees, which may be taxable.</strong> <br> <strong>The KRA stipulates that:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Taxable Benefits:</strong> Value of car benefits, housing provided by the employer, loans at interest rates lower than the prevailing market rate, and meal benefits exceeding KSh 5,000 per month or KSh 60,000 per year.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Taxable Benefits:</strong> Meals provided by the employer up to a maximum of KSh 5,000 per month or KSh 60,000 per year, night-out allowances of KSh 2,000 per day, medical cover by the employer, and pension contributions made by an employer to a registered or unregistered scheme within the allowable limit of KSh 30,000 per month or KSh 360,000 per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>([kra.go.ke](https://www.kra.go.ke/images/publications/PAYE-AS-YOU-EARN-PAYE_4-01-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>Recent Legislative Changes Impacting PAYE</h2>

<h3>Finance Bill 2025</h3>
<p><strong>The Finance Bill 2025 mandates that employers automatically apply all eligible PAYE tax reliefs and exemptions during payroll processing, effective from July 1, 2025.</strong> <br> <strong>This change aims to streamline the tax process and reduce the burden on employees who previously had to seek refunds from the KRA directly.</strong> ([payroll.org](https://payroll.org/news-resources/news/news-detail/2025/05/12/kenya-mandates-automatic-paye-tax-relief-starting-1-july-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h3>Rejected Amendments</h3>
<p><strong>Proposed amendments to the PAYE tax bands and rates were rejected by the National Assembly's Finance Committee.</strong> <br> <strong>The proposed changes included expanding the tax bands to 10%, 17.5%, 25%, 27.5%, and 30%, with the lowest tax band raised to KSh 30,000 and personal relief increased to KSh 3,000 per month.</strong> <br> <strong>The committee emphasized the need for a broader, data-driven review of the PAYE structure to ensure it is fair, equitable, and aligned with Kenya‚Äôs economic realities.</strong> ([the-star.co.ke](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2025-06-17-mps-reject-treasurys-paye-tax-band-changes?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>How to Calculate Your PAYE</h2>

<p>To calculate your PAYE:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Determine Gross Income:</strong> Include all earnings such as salary, bonuses, and allowances.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply Statutory Deductions:</strong> Subtract NSSF, SHIF, and housing levy contributions.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply Tax Bands:</strong> Use the applicable tax bands to compute the tax payable.</li>
  <li><strong>Subtract Personal Relief:</strong> Deduct the personal relief of KSh 2,400 per month.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Online tools and calculators, such as the one provided by the KRA, can assist in this process.</strong> ([calculator.co.ke](https://calculator.co.ke/paye-calculator-for-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>Filing and Remitting PAYE</h2>

<p><strong>Employers are required to deduct PAYE from employees' emoluments and remit the amounts deducted to the KRA on or before the 9th day of the following month.</strong> <br> <strong>A PAYE return should also be filed through the iTax portal by the same deadline.</strong> <br> <strong>Late payments attract penalties, including fines and interest on arrears.</strong> ([kra.go.ke](https://www.kra.go.ke/individual/filing-paying/types-of-taxes/paye?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<h2>Common PAYE Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Underreporting Income:</strong> Ensure all sources of income are accurately reported.</li>
  <li><strong>Incorrect Application of Tax Bands:</strong> Apply the correct tax rates to the appropriate income bands.</li>
  <li><strong>Failure to Account for Deductions and Reliefs:</strong> Incorporate all eligible deductions and reliefs to reduce tax liability.</li>
  <li><strong>Late Remittance of PAYE:</strong> Remit PAYE on time to avoid penalties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
