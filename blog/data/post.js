      <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For most salaried workers in Kenya, PAYE â€“ short for Pay As You Earn â€“ is a standard deduction on their monthly payslip. It is the system through which income tax is collected by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) directly from employees' salaries before they receive them.</p>
<p>Even though PAYE is common, many Kenyans do not fully understand how it works. How is it calculated? What deductions are involved? Who qualifies to pay it? If you are an employee, employer, or business owner in Kenya, understanding PAYE can help you stay compliant, avoid penalties, and better manage your finances.</p>

<h2>1. What Is PAYE and Who Pays It?</h2>
<p>PAYE is the method used by the Kenyan government to collect income tax from people who earn a regular wage or salary. Instead of paying tax at the end of the year, a portion of your income is deducted automatically each month and sent to KRA by your employer.</p>
<p><strong>Who Pays PAYE?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All employees earning above a certain monthly income threshold</li>
  <li>Both permanent and contract workers</li>
  <li>Kenyan citizens and foreigners working in Kenya (if employed)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your total monthly income is below the taxable bracket, you may not be subject to PAYE. However, once your income goes above the threshold, your employer must begin deducting and remitting PAYE to the KRA.</p>

<h2>2. How Is PAYE Calculated in Kenya?</h2>
<p>The amount of PAYE you pay depends on your gross monthly income and the current income tax bands set by the KRA. Tax is applied in a graduated format, meaning the more you earn, the higher the percentage of tax you pay on each portion of your income.</p>
<p><strong>As of the 2024/2025 tax year, the monthly PAYE tax bands are:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>First KSh 24,000: 10 percent</li>
  <li>Next KSh 8,333: 25 percent</li>
  <li>Income above KSh 32,333: 30 percent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Calculation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>First KSh 24,000 taxed at 10% = KSh 2,400</li>
  <li>Next KSh 8,333 taxed at 25% = KSh 2,083.25</li>
  <li>Remaining KSh 27,667 taxed at 30% = KSh 8,300.10</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total PAYE before reliefs = KSh 12,783.35</strong></p>
<p>Then subtract applicable reliefs (like personal relief) to arrive at the final PAYE payable.</p>

<h2>3. Allowable Deductions and Reliefs</h2>
<p>KRA allows for certain deductions and reliefs to reduce the amount of tax you pay through PAYE. These are legal and often meant to encourage savings, insurance, and social welfare participation.</p>
<p><strong>Common Reliefs</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Relief:</strong> KSh 2,400 per month (2024)</li>
  <li><strong>Insurance Relief:</strong> Up to 15% of insurance premiums paid</li>
  <li><strong>Retirement Contributions:</strong> Contributions to registered pension schemes or NSSF are deductible</li>
  <li><strong>Mortgage Interest:</strong> Interest on home loans may be deductible</li>
  <li><strong>Disability Relief:</strong> Full relief up to a set income limit for registered persons</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Employer Responsibilities Under PAYE</h2>
<p>Employers play a crucial role in the PAYE process. They are responsible for deducting the correct amount from employee salaries and remitting it on time.</p>
<p><strong>Key Employer Duties:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Deduct PAYE accurately using current tax bands</li>
  <li>Remit PAYE to KRA by the 9th of the following month</li>
  <li>Issue P9 forms annually</li>
  <li>Provide payslips showing PAYE and other deductions (NHIF, NSSF)</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Employee Responsibilities and PAYE Returns</h2>
<p>Even though your employer submits PAYE, you are still required to file your annual returns.</p>
<p><strong>What You Need to Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check your payslip to verify PAYE deductions</li>
  <li>Register on <a href="https://itax.kra.go.ke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTax</a></li>
  <li>File your return between January and June annually</li>
  <li>Declare other income (e.g. rent, freelance)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Common PAYE Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not filing returns â€“ even if PAYE is deducted</li>
  <li>Wrong KRA PIN or employer details on iTax</li>
  <li>Forgetting to update insurance or mortgage reliefs</li>
  <li>Employer failing to remit deducted PAYE</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. PAYE for Different Income Types</h2>
<p><strong>a. Permanent Employees</strong></p>
<p>Most full-time salaried employees are taxed through the standard PAYE system.</p>

<p><strong>b. Contract and Temporary Workers</strong></p>
<p>They may be taxed under PAYE if on payroll, or else via withholding tax/self-assessment.</p>

<p><strong>c. Bonuses, Commissions, and Overtime</strong></p>
<p>These earnings are taxed just like your basic salary and may push your income into a higher band.</p>

<p><strong>d. Fringe Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Perks like housing or car benefits are taxed separately under fringe benefit tax, usually paid by the employer.</p>

<h2>8. PAYE vs Other Deductions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PAYE:</strong> Income tax based on salary, collected by KRA</li>
  <li><strong>NHIF:</strong> Health insurance, fixed monthly rates</li>
  <li><strong>NSSF:</strong> Retirement contributions, typically 6% of salary</li>
  <li><strong>HELB:</strong> Loan repayment for graduates with education loans</li>
</ul>
